# PROJECT-about-matching
This project is talked about a paper of " COLLEGE ADMISSIONS AND THE STABILITY OF MARRIAGE", and how I use this algorithm to complete college admission

Before running u have to download Headerfun.h, differtinating grade.txt, rank.csv, school.list.csv, student_list.csv, algorithm.h, project.cpp

The "differtinating grade.txt" convert Chinese to integer point, e.t. 均標 -> 12. It can increase convenience of modifying data.

Headerfun.h is how I input data to the map

If u want to test data, u can use the title begin of 'new' csv file
