# PROJECT-about-matching
This project is talked about ***COLLEGE ADMISSIONS AND THE STABILITY OF MARRIAGE*** by  D. Gale and L. S. Shapley, and how I use this algorithm to complete college admission

Before running u have to download **Headerfun.h, differtinating grade.txt, rank.csv, school.list.csv, student_list.csv, algorithm.h, project.cpp**

The **differtinating grade.txt** convert Chinese to integer score, e.t. 均標 -> 12. It can increase convenience of modifying data.

**Headerfun.h** is how I input data to the map

And at the first half of **project.cpp** is how I manage different file's data to create school's order of preference of student.

If u want to test data, u can use the title begin of 'new' csv file in *Simple Tesst* file
